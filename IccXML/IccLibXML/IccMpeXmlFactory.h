////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
// HISTORY:
//
// -Feb 4, 2006 
//  A CIccMpeCreator singleton class has been added to provide general
//  support for dynamically creating element classes using a element signature.
//  Prototype and private element type support can be added to the system
//  by pushing additional IIccMpeFactory based objects to the 
//  singleton CIccMpeCreator object.
//
// -Nov 6, 2006
//  Merged into release
