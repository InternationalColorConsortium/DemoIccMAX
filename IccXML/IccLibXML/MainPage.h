 *
 * IccLibXML was written as an extension of SampleICC's IccProfLib.
 * This extension provides Inherited classes for the classes in IccProfLib
 * that provide additional I/O routines to read and write the classes as
 * XML files.  As such, it provides the means of converting ICC profiles
 * into and out of an XML format (hereafter referred to as icc.XML).
 * Documentation for the schema for the icc.XML in the library can be
 * found as part the ICCXML project distribution.  
 * 
 * Along with the IccLibXML library are two command line tools provided:
 * - IccToXML to convert an ICC profile file into and icc.XML file.
 * - IccFromXML to convert an icc.XML file into an ICC profile file.
 * 
 * Since IccLibXML is an extension of IccProfLib, an icc.XML file can be
 * parsed creating a CIccProfile object, and then used as if it had been
 * read from an actual ICC profile.
 * 
 * The purpose of the ICCXML project is to provide a means of convering
 * the data in an ICC profile into a human readable, editable format that
 * can then be converted back into somthing that can be used for color
 * management.  
 * 
 * Having an XML representation of ICC profiles is not meant as a
 * replacement for ICC profiles.  XML is much less efficient in terms of
 * storage, and many support mechanisms are already in place for the use of
 * ICC profiles that will not operate well with XML data.  However, there
 * are times where a human readable/editable form for ICC profile data
 * can be useful.
 * 
 * Note: At this point the icc.XML schema used to represent ICC profiles
 * has not been approved by the ICC.  This schema is currently subject to change,
 * and has not undergone the process of any formal standardization.  Additionally,
 * the XML schema documentation and data representaiton should not be used
 * as a replacement for the ICC profile specificaiton provided by the ICC
 * which does undergo a formal standardization process.
