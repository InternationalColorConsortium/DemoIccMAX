ABOUT THE ICCXML PROJECT
---------------------------

IccLibXML library acts as an extension of SampleICC's IccProfLib.
This extension provides Inherited classes for the classes in IccProfLib
that provide additional I/O routines to read and write the classes as
XML files.  As such, it provides the means of converting ICC profiles
into and out of an XML format (hereafter referred to as icc.XML).
Documentation for the schema for the icc.XML in the library can be
found as part the ICCXML project distribution.   IccLibXML also uses
libxml2 for the purposes of parsing XML files.  The libxml2 libraries
need to be separately installed before building this project.

This project is known to work with SampleICC's IccProfLib version 1.6.3.

Along with the IccLibXML library are two command line tools provided:
-IccToXML to convert an ICC profile file into an icc.XML file.
-IccFromXML to convert an icc.XML file into an ICC profile file.

Since IccLibXML is an extension of IccProfLib, an icc.XML file can be
parsed creating a CIccProfile object, and then used as if it had been
read from an ICC profile.

The purpose of the ICCXML project is to provide a means of convering
the data in an ICC profile into a human readable, editable format that
can then be converted back into somthing that can be used for color
management.  

Having an XML representation of ICC profiles is not meant as a
replacement for ICC profiles.  XML is much less efficient in terms of
storage, and many support mechanisms are already in place for the use of
ICC profiles that will not operate well with XML data.  However, there
are times where a human readable/editable form for ICC profile data
can be useful.

XML parsing within IccLibXML makes use of the Libxml2 project (found
at http://xmlsoft.org).  The Libxml2 project tree will need to be
separately installed before the tools in IccLibXML can be properly
built.  The Libxml2 project also relies on libiconv (found at 
http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) and zlib (found at 
http://www.zlib.net/).

Note: At this point the icc.XML schema used to represent ICC profiles
has not been approved by the ICC.  This schema is currently subject to change,
and has not undergone the process of formal standardization.  Additionally,
the XML schema documentation and data representation should not be used
as a replacement for the ICC profile specification provided by the ICC
which does undergo a formal standardization process.

INSTALLATION
------------
This project requires that SampleICC folder tree is first installed.
Then place the IccXML folder tree as a child folder of the base SampleIcc folder.
