# ICC XML HTTP Service - WIP

**Work in Progress**

RESTful service for bidirectional conversion between ICC XML and .icc using iccMAX.

---

## 📌 Features

- **POST endpoints** for ICC XML → `.icc` and `.icc` → XML
- Built on the **iccMAX reference implementation**
- Enables structured roundtrip validation
- Exposes **HTTP interfaces** for fuzzing, CI, and test automation
- Supports integration with tools like **AFL**, **Burp Suite**, and custom harnesses
- Logs stderr, exit codes, and raw inputs for postmortem and traceability
- Foundation for expanding **iccMAX tooling as network services**

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the Service

```bash
iccFromXml_http_service.exe
```

### Send a Request

**bash**
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8182/iccfromxml --data-binary "@example.icc.xml" --output profile.icc
```

**pwsh**

```
 & "C:\Windows\System32\curl.exe" -X POST http://localhost:8082/icctoxml --data-binary "@input.xml" --output result.icc
```

---

## 📂 Log Output

- `logs/service_startup.log` — startup banners with timestamps
- `logs/log_req_<timestamp>.log` — per-request stderr + status
- `failed_xml/fail_input_<timestamp>.xml` — archived input on failure

---

## 🧪 Fuzzing-Ready

This service is ready for fuzzing with:

- **Burp Suite**
- **AFLNet**
- **REST API fuzzers**
- Your custom toolchains

Use malformed XML, compression bombs, or invalid attributes to test your Code!

***iccMAX is _NOT_ Production Ready***

### Sample Output


```
F:\pr121a\PatchIccMAX\Build\iis>run_service.bat

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Input size is not validated — use in isolated test environments.
- XML parser is libxml2 — known to tolerate many malformed patterns.
