# DemoIccMAX Project - Unit Tests and Build Scripts

This directory contains various scripts, test files, and documentation related to the DemoIccMAX project. The scripts and tests focus on profile creation, cross-checking, build verification, and sanitization (Asan/UBSan) for detecting memory-related issues. The purpose of these scripts is to automate testing, ensure code correctness, and track any vulnerabilities in the DemoIccMAX project.


## Directory Structure

### Profile Creation and Testing Scripts

- [CreateAllProfiles.sh](https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/DemoIccMAX/tree/development/contrib/UnitTest/CreateAllProfiles.sh)  
  Automates the process of creating ICC profiles within the DemoIccMAX environment. The script is designed to validate profile creation by running tests and generating logs for analysis.

**Run:**

   ```
   cd Testing/
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InternationalColorConsortium/DemoIccMAX/refs/heads/master/contrib/UnitTest/CreateAllProfiles.sh)"
   ```

  A more comprehensive profile creation script that performs cross-checks on the generated profiles. It ensures consistency and correctness across profiles by comparing them to a reference set.

**Run:**

   ```
   cd Testing/
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InternationalColorConsortium/DemoIccMAX/refs/heads/master/contrib/UnitTest/CreateAllProfiles_cross_check.sh)"
   ```

- [CreateAllProfiles_cross_check.md](https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/DemoIccMAX/tree/master/contrib/UnitTest/CreateAllProfiles_cross_check.md)
