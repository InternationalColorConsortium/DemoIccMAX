# IccMAX

## Introduction

The IccMAX project (formally known as RefIccMAX, or DemoIccMAX) provides an open source set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation, and application of iccMAX based color management profiles based on the [iccMAX profile specification](http://www.color.org/iccmax.xalter) in addition to legacy ICC profiles defined by [earlier ICC profile specifications](http://www.color.org/icc_specs2.xalter) and [documentation](ReadMeFiles/Readme.md).


Within the project are several libraries and tools as follows:

* Libraries that allow applications to interact with iccMAX profiles

  * IccProfLib - The IccMAX IccProfLib project represents an open source &
    cross platform reference implementation of a C++ library for reading,
    writing, applying, manipulating iccMAX color profiles defined by the [iccMAX
    profile specification](http://www.color.org/iccmax.xalter). Class and object
    interaction documentation for IccProfLib in [Doxygen](https://xss.cx/public/docs/IccMAX/).
