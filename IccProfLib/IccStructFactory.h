// HISTORY:
//
// -Jun 10, 2011 
//  A CIccStructCreator singleton class has been added to provide general
//  support for dynamically creating struct object classes using a signature.
//  Prototype and private struct type support can be added to the system
//  by pushing additional IIccStructFactory based objects to the 
//  singleton CIccStructCreator object.
