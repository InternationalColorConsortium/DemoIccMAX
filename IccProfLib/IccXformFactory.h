// HISTORY:
//
// -Nov 21, 2007 
//  A CIccXformCreator singleton class has been added to provide general
//  support for dynamically creating xform classes using a xform type.
//  Prototype and private xform type support can be added to the system
//  by pushing additional IIccXformFactory based objects to the 
//  singleton CIccXformCreator object.
