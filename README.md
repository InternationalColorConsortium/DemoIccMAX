# iccDEV

## Introduction

The purpose of the International Color Consortium (ICC) is to promote
the use and adoption of open, vendor-neutral, cross-platform color management systems.
The International Color Consortium encourages vendors to support the ICC profile
format and the workflows required to use ICC profiles.

The iccDEV project (formally known as DemoIccMAX) provides an
open source set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation,
and application of ICC based color management profiles based on the 
[ICC profile specification](http://www.color.org/icc_specs2.xalter) and 
[iccMAX profile specification](http://www.color.org/iccmax.xalter).

All documentation is in the "docs" directory. If you're just getting started, 
here's how we recommend you read the Introduction for a list of features and 
libraries included in iccDEV.


## Quickstart

Install iccDEV using the Homebrew package manager:

`brew install iccdev`

To build from source view the [Build documentation](docs/build.md).

## Contributing

This software consists of voluntary contributions made by many individuals
on behalf of the The International Color Consortium.

The first thing to do, before anything else, is talk to us! Whether you're
reporting an issue, requesting or implementing a feature, or just asking a
question; please don’t hesitate to reach out to project maintainers or the
community as a whole. This is an important first step because your issue,
feature, or the question may have been solved or discussed already, and you’ll
save yourself a lot of time by asking first.
